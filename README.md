# BST-Implementation
Implementation of a Binary Search Tree in C++

This project provides a simple and clear implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST) in modern C++. It includes all the fundamental operations such as insertion, deletion, search, and tree traversals (in-order, pre-order, and post-order). 

## Features
- Insert and remove nodes
- Search for elements
- Find minimum and maximum values
- Check if the tree is empty
- Get the size and height of the tree
- Clear the entire tree
- Support for copy and move semantics
- In-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals

## File Structure
- `bst.h` – BST class declaration (templated)
- `bst.cpp` – BST class implementation
- `main.cpp` – Test driver for demonstrating BST functionality

## Build & Run
You can compile the project using `g++`:

```bash
g++ -std=c++17 -o bst main.cpp bst.cpp
./bst
```
